# PostgreSQL_Connect

WebCTRL is a trademark of Automated Logic Corporation.  Any other trademarks mentioned herein are the property of their respective owners.

This WebCTRL add-on periodically synchronizes operator, add-on, and other data to an external PostgreSQL database. By connecting multiple WebCTRL servers to the same PostgreSQL database, it is possible to sync a subset of whitelisted operators and add-ons between all servers. Some data collection features are supported as well.

Currently, this is a work-in-progress. The functionality of the add-on is complete, but it is rather technical to setup, and the front-end is not very polished. So check back in a year to see what this becomes.
